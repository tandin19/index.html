        <h2>The Legacy of Bhutanese Monarchy: Chronicles of Kings</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The monarchy, a representation of progress, unity, and history, is a stabilising force in Bhutan. Since the nation's founding in 1907, when they were entrusted with safeguarding its rich cultural heritage and directing its modern development, the monarchs of Bhutan have been held in the highest regard. From the adored King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck to the forward-thinking King Ugyen Wangchuck, every monarch of Bhutan has had a significant influence on the nation's culture and society. They have preserved the traditional values of harmony, compassion, and gross national happiness while guiding the country towards prosperity. Join us as we explore the monarchy's history in Bhutan and honour the legacies of its esteemed rulers.</p>
